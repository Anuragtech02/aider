##### Stay Informed & Organized with Aider

Aider means to help. Aider is an Android application built with student's needs in mind.
This app is neighter a mangement portal not an attendance app. This is much more. Aider informs the students about the ongoing of the college in 50 seconds, it also helps students raise an issue and ask for their opinion, it autmatically curates content relevant to students syllabus thus helping them study, it records historic data about students who clear GATE, GRE, CAT or get good placements.

### Why ?
As students, do you feel secluded from the happens of your college, Do you ever feel like something is not goiing right but cant do anything about it ? Do you have to ask your class representative repeatldy about online classes and stuff becuse the college website is not enough.
##### yes !
Well now you have an app for it. We discussed what problems are faced by college authoorites and students, it was not hard to figure them out, then we went on to create a extremely simplfied tool for students and staff and one by one found soultion for all of them. Thus Aider came to existence

### Example Scenerio

Let's imagine, Different Companies are visiting our college for placements.
##### Feature 1 - Stories
Each day a new company offeres job to some of the final year students. We are second year students, all information about placement we get it from our seniors. With Aider, College authorites can go to Admin console (of Aider) and write a single line "20 Students places in VMware". That's it. Aider automatically generates a beutiful story, so whenever a students opens the app next time, he can get this info.
